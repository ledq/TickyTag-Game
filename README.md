# Description:
This game is a “mutant” version of the commonly known “Tag” game in real life. There are two 
players. Each player will (randomly) be the chaser or the runner (who runs away from the 
chaser). Each time the chaser successfully “tag” the runner, the players swap the role. Players use 
the keys on the keyboard to control their characters to move and use skills. Sometimes the Power 
Gems would occur randomly on the map, and the players can collect them to gain their Skill Bar, 
which enables them to use skills. There is a timer, and the player who is the runner when time’s 
up will win the game.
